                both feet make him a versatile and unpredictable forward.

                In addition to his club success, Kane has been a pivotal player for the England national team. He played
                a crucial role in England's journey to the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where he was awarded
                the Golden Boot for being the tournament's top scorer. Kane's leadership on the field, combined with his
                relentless drive to win, has earned him the captaincy of the national team, further solidifying his
                status as one of football's greats.
